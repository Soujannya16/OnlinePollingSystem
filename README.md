## Introduction
‘Online Polling System’ is an online voting technique.  In this system, people of India who have citizenship and whose age is above 18 years of age can give their vote online without going to any physical polling station.

There is a database which is maintained in which all the names of voters with complete information are stored.

In Online Voting System, a voter can use their voting right online without any difficulty.  Voter has to be registered first.  Registration is mainly done by the system administrator for security reasons.  The system Administrator registers the voters on a special site of the system visited by him only by simply filling a registration form to register voter.  Citizens seeking registration are expected to contact the system administrator to submit their details.  After the validity of them being citizens of India has been confirmed by the system administrator by comparing their details submitted with those in existing database such as those as the Registrar of persons, the citizen is then registered as a voter.

After registration, the voter is assigned a secret Voter ID with which the voter can use to log into the system and enjoy services provided by the system. 

## Purpose
The online polling system in India shall reduce the time spend making long queue at the polling stations during voting.  It shall also enable the voter to vote from anywhere since this is an online application available on the internet. Cases of vote miscounts shall also be solved since at the backend of this system resides a well-developed database using MYSQL that can provide the correct data once it is correctly queried.

## Future Scope
The offline experience revealed that they are often confronted by security issues while the online voting system is running.  The origin of the security issues was due to not only outsider but also insider even just because the inheritance of some objects in the source code is unsuitable.  These errors caused the voting system to crash.

The proposed solutions were correspondingly outlines to holdback these attacks.  For example, to avoid hacker making incursion into the voting system via network, we can design our system to transmit data without network.  Another example is to limit voter to input particular data, so that we can prevent the command injection from running.

## Code
The src directory contains the java files and web directory inside build, contains the html and jsp files.
